        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and pressed</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain panko breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Firecracker Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank’s Red Hot® Buffalo Wing Sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with foil, and lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Stir egg, jalapeño, soy sauce, onion powder, ginger, garlic, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add ground chicken and breadcrumbs, and gently mix just until just combined.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Form into meatballs using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop; shape with wet hands. Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Meanwhile, for firecracker sauce, combine hot sauce, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat to cool. The sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Dip each meatball into sauce or brush each meatball with sauce, return to the baking sheet, and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Drizzle or brush with additional sauce as desired, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
