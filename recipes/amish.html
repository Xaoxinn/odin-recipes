        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Amish beef and noodles is a very simple dish, with very few ingredients. It's the technique that makes this comforting, satisfying, and heavenly.</p>
        <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for the top</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large yellow onions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 rounded tablespoon beef bouillon paste</li>
            <li>8 cups beef broth, divided</li>
            <li>12 ounces large egg noodles</li>
            <li>sliced green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss beef with salt and pepper until evenly coated.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil on high heat in a Dutch oven. Brown the beef thoroughly on both sides, doing half at a time, and remove to a bowl. Turn off heat.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Add butter to Dutch oven, along with onions and a pinch of salt. Turn heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until onions turn golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Add flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add garlic powder, beef base, and beef broth. Stir, and wait for broth to come to a boil. Add reserved beef back in.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Stir, and cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until meat is very tender, about 2 hours.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Use a strainer to remove beef to a bowl and reserve. Bring both to a boil on high heat, and add noodles. Cook, stirring, until the noodles are almost tender, about 30-60 seconds less than package directions. Stir in beef and reduce heat to low.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Once noodles are tender and beef is heated through, taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately topped with more freshly ground black pepper and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
