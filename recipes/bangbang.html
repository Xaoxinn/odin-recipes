        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This bang bang chicken casserole is an all-in-one chicken and rice dish topped with a bang bang sauce inspired by Bonefish Grill's iconic Bang Bang Shrimp.</p>
        <p>Spiced and sauteed chicken baked over rice in a single skillet minimizes hands-on time, and results in a spicy, savory dish with a hint of sweetness.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Sriracha chile sauce, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked white jasmine rice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Toss together chicken, onion powder, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon garlic until well combined in a large bowl. Sprinkle with flour until completely coated.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, add chicken in an even layer; cook, undisturbed, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes total, flipping halfway through. Transfer chicken to a plate. Do not wipe skillet clean. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in rice, 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and rice is toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Stir in broth and bring to a boil over medium-high. Remove from heat and top evenly with chicken. Cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and cooked through, 22 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together mayonnaise, remaining 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar until smooth. Transfer to a squeeze bottle, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag, reseal the bag, and cut off a small corner.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>Drizzle casserole with bang bang sauce as desired. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
